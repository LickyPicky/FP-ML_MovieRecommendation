## Description
[**‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: Briefly describe your project. What does it do? What's its main goal?**
Example: This project implements a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their past rating behavior. It leverages collaborative filtering techniques to predict user preferences and generate personalized recommendations.]

## Why This Project?
This movie recommendation system was developed as the **Final Project for the Machine Learning course (CSAC 224) at Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges.**

## Features
*   Predicts movie ratings for users.
*   Generates Top-N movie recommendations for a specified user.
*   Evaluates model performance using metrics such as RMSE, Precision@10, Recall@10, and F1-score@10.
*   Demonstrates the application of [mention your primary algorithm/technique, e.g., Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), K-Nearest Neighbors] for recommendation tasks.
*   [**‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: Add any other specific features demonstrated in your notebook.**]

## Technologies Used
*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For demonstration, analysis, and presentation of the system.
*   **Pandas:** For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **[Your Recommendation Library/Core Logic]:** e.g., `Surprise` library, `Scikit-learn` (if used for specific parts like KNN or SVD), or custom implementation logic.
*   **Matplotlib / Seaborn (Optional):** If used for visualizations within the notebook.

## Dataset
This system is trained and evaluated on the **[‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: Your Dataset Name, e.g., MovieLens 100K, a custom subset of TMDB]**.
*   **Source:** [‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: Link to the dataset if applicable, or mention if it's included directly]
*   **Files Included:**
    *   `[‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: name_of_your_ratings_file.csv]` - Contains user ratings for movies.
    *   `[‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: name_of_your_movies_file.csv]` - Contains movie metadata like titles and genres.
    *   (Add any other relevant CSV files)
*   **Description:** The dataset contains [e.g., X ratings from Y users for Z movies].

## Repository Contents
This repository contains:
1.  **`[‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: Your_Jupyter_Notebook_Name.ipynb]`**: The main Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the entire movie recommendation process, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and generating recommendations.
2.  **`data/` directory (or similar)**: Containing the necessary CSV files:
    *   `[‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: name_of_your_ratings_file.csv]`
    *   `[‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: name_of_your_movies_file.csv]`
    *   (and any others)
3.  **`README.md`**: This file.

## Usage
To view and run the movie recommendation system:
1.  Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2.  Download or clone this repository.
3.  Navigate to the repository's directory in your terminal.
4.  Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  Open the `[‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: MovieRecommend.ipynb]` file from the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser.
6.  You can then run the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the system in action.

**Note:** This project is primarily for demonstration within the Jupyter Notebook environment. Guidance for local installation or deployment as a standalone application is not provided.

## Example Output / Results (from the Notebook)

The system's performance metrics on the test set, as demonstrated in the notebook, are:
*   **RMSE:** 0.7717
*   **RMSE on test set (more precise):** 0.7717007704524537
*   **Precision@10 (threshold=3.5):** 0.8120
*   **Recall@10 (threshold=3.5):** 0.5714
*   **F1-score@10 (threshold=3.5):** 0.6708

An example recommendation for User ID 18:
*   **Context (User's Top Rated):** American Beauty (5.0), Big Lebowski (5.0), etc.
*   **Top Recommendations:** Decalogue (Pred: 4.90), Wizard of Oz (Pred: 4.88), etc.


## How It Works (Briefly - as demonstrated in the Notebook)
The recommendation logic implemented in the notebook is based on User-Based Collaborative Filtering using  Matrix Factorization (SVD).

[‚û°Ô∏è YOU ARE HERE: Add a sentence or two more explaining the core idea of your approach as implemented.
For example:
- *Collaborative Filtering:* The notebook demonstrates finding users similar to a target user based on their rating patterns and then recommends items liked by these similar users.
- *Matrix Factorization (like SVD):* The notebook shows how the user-item interaction matrix is decomposed into latent factor matrices to predict missing ratings.]
